            <h2>1. Introduction &amp; Acceptance of Terms</h2>
            <p>
                By using Home Reno Hotspot's services—including our website, SMS communications, or any other platform interaction—you agree to be bound by these Terms of Service. If you do not agree to these terms, do not use our services.
            </p>
            <p>
                You must be <strong>18 years of age or older</strong> to use Home Reno Hotspot. These terms apply to both <strong>homeowners</strong> and <strong>contractors</strong> who use the platform.

            <h2>2. Description of Service</h2>
            <p>
                Home Reno Hotspot is a technology platform that connects homeowners seeking renovation services with independent contractors in the New York City metro area. We are not a contractor, general contractor, subcontractor, or construction manager.
            </p>
            <p>
                The platform uses automated, AI-powered qualification systems to assess homeowner project needs and to facilitate matching. We use data enrichment and scoring algorithms to vet and match contractors based on publicly available and user-provided information. Home Reno Hotspot <strong>facilitates introductions only</strong> and does not perform, manage, supervise, or oversee any renovation work.
            </p>

                <strong class="legal">Home Reno Hotspot is a matching and referral platform only.</strong> We are NOT a contractor, general contractor, subcontractor, or construction manager.

                <li>A contractor's licensing, bonding, insurance status, or qualifications (even though we score and vet contractors using available data, this vetting is informational and does not constitute a guarantee or certification)</li>

            <h2>4. Contractor Vetting Disclaimer</h2>
            <p>
                Home Reno Hotspot uses publicly available data sources including but not limited to NYC Department of Buildings records, NYC open data (SODA), Google Places, Yelp, and other third-party sources to score and assess contractors. This scoring is based on available data at the time of assessment and is for internal matching purposes only.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong class="legal">Contractor scores and assessments do NOT constitute a certification, endorsement, license verification, or guarantee of competence.</strong> Data from third-party sources may be incomplete, outdated, or inaccurate—Home Reno Hotspot is not responsible for the accuracy of third-party data. Homeowners should conduct their own due diligence, including verifying licenses, insurance, and references, before hiring any contractor.
            </p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>5. AI and Automated Decision-Making Disclosure</h2>
            <p>
                Home Reno Hotspot uses artificial intelligence and automated systems to qualify homeowner leads, score contractors, and facilitate matching. Automated qualification determines whether a homeowner's project meets criteria for contractor matching—this is not a guarantee of service or of any particular outcome.
            </p>
            <p>
                By using the platform, you acknowledge and consent to the use of these automated systems in the delivery of our services.

            <h2>6. Data Collection from Public Sources</h2>
            <p>
                In addition to information you voluntarily provide, Home Reno Hotspot collects and processes publicly available data, including property records, building permits, violations, property assessments, mortgage/refinance records, and demographic information. This data is used for predictive modeling, targeting, matching, and improving service quality. Such collection is separate from and in addition to information users provide directly.

            </p>
            <p>
                Contractors are solely responsible for their own licensing, insurance, bonding, permits, workmanship, and compliance with all applicable laws. Contractors must maintain all required NYC and New York State licenses and insurance throughout their subscription. Home Reno Hotspot reserves the right to remove any contractor from the platform at any time for any reason.
